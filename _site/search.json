We can see that there are 21 columns, with the following data types:\n\ndoubles: Transacted Price ($), Area (SQFT), Unit Price ($ PSF), Area (SQM), Unit Price ($ PSM), Number of Units\ncharacters: the rest of the 16 variables, including Quarter\n\nInterestingly, Nett Price is classified as characters, as it contains - character, although the rest of the columns should return doubles like Transacted Price ($)\n\nThe CodeThe Output\n\n\n\n# have a basic understanding for all 22 variables\nglimpse(df)\n\n\n\n\n\nRows: 26,806\nColumns: 22\n$ `Project Name`                &lt;chr&gt; \"THE REEF AT KING'S DOCK\", \"URBAN TREASU…\n$ `Transacted Price ($)`        &lt;dbl&gt; 2317000, 1823500, 1421112, 1258112, 1280…\n$ `Area (SQFT)`                 &lt;dbl&gt; 882.65, 882.65, 1076.40, 1033.34, 871.88…\n$ `Unit Price ($ PSF)`          &lt;dbl&gt; 2625, 2066, 1320, 1218, 1468, 1767, 1095…\n$ `Sale Date`                   &lt;chr&gt; \"01 Jan 2023\", \"02 Jan 2023\", \"02 Jan 20…\n$ Address                       &lt;chr&gt; \"12 HARBOURFRONT AVENUE #05-32\", \"205 JA…\n$ `Type of Sale`                &lt;chr&gt; \"New Sale\", \"New Sale\", \"New Sale\", \"New…\n$ `Type of Area`                &lt;chr&gt; \"Strata\", \"Strata\", \"Strata\", \"Strata\", …\n$ `Area (SQM)`                  &lt;dbl&gt; 82.0, 82.0, 100.0, 96.0, 81.0, 308.7, 42…\n$ `Unit Price ($ PSM)`          &lt;dbl&gt; 28256, 22238, 14211, 13105, 15802, 19015…\n$ `Nett Price($)`               &lt;chr&gt; \"-\", \"-\", \"-\", \"-\", \"-\", \"-\", \"-\", \"-\", …\n$ `Property Type`               &lt;chr&gt; \"Condominium\", \"Condominium\", \"Executive…\n$ `Number of Units`             &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1…\n$ Tenure                        &lt;chr&gt; \"99 yrs from 12/01/2021\", \"Freehold\", \"9…\n$ `Completion Date`             &lt;chr&gt; \"Uncompleted\", \"Uncompleted\", \"Uncomplet…\n$ `Purchaser Address Indicator` &lt;chr&gt; \"HDB\", \"Private\", \"HDB\", \"HDB\", \"HDB\", \"…\n$ `Postal Code`                 &lt;chr&gt; \"097996\", \"419535\", \"269343\", \"269294\", …\n$ `Postal District`             &lt;chr&gt; \"04\", \"14\", \"27\", \"27\", \"28\", \"19\", \"10\"…\n$ `Postal Sector`               &lt;chr&gt; \"09\", \"41\", \"26\", \"26\", \"79\", \"54\", \"27\"…\n$ `Planning Region`             &lt;chr&gt; \"Central Region\", \"East Region\", \"North …\n$ `Planning Area`               &lt;chr&gt; \"Bukit Merah\", \"Bedok\", \"Yishun\", \"Yishu…\n$ Quarter                       &lt;chr&gt; \"23Q1\", \"23Q1\", \"23Q1\", \"23Q1\", \"23Q1\", …\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn top of the data types that is automatically assigned by R to help the program know how to process it, we can split the data into 4 types of data category to help ourselves for future analytics application.

For example, I can choose to fill in the order for Purchaser Address Indicator as Private category is higher order than HDB category. The context is purchaser that address is Private is likely to be a person with higher Social Economic Status (SES) compared to a purchaser with HDB as address. Same could be applied to Postal Code, Postal District, Postal Sector, Planning Region and Planning Area.\nSpecial Case: Tenure is still a character data type as of now. If we choose to use this column for analysis, we do need to do data preparation on this. Tenure date could also be classified under continuous data for more granularity. This variable will be a mixture of nominal data type with categories like “Freehold”, and also quantitative data type using its Tenure date.\nNett Price($) is still a character data type as of now. If we choose to use this column for analysis, we do need to do data preparation on this.\nSpecial Case: Completion Date is classified as character, but a quick look at the data df, we will realise that this variable is a mix of quantitative and qualitative data type of Uncomplete and actual date of completion, which could be converted and analyse as doubles.\n\nFor simplicity of data analysis\n1. Transacted Price ($) and Nett Price($) are similar. In this analysis, we will use Transacted Price ($) for simplicity, as Nett Price($) has fair amount of missing data, and it is prices after deducting the value of the indirect discounts or benefits, and not representative for all transactions.\n\nArea (SQFT) and Area (SQM), and Unit Price ($ PSF) and Unit Price ($ PSM) are similar measures in different unit. We will use Area (SQFT) and Unit Price ($ PSF)\n\nNext we look at the basic statistics of the current data using summary()\n\nThe OutputThe Code\n\n\n\n\n Project Name       Transacted Price ($)  Area (SQFT)       Unit Price ($ PSF)\n Length:26806       Min.   :   440000    Min.   :   322.9   Min.   : 138      \n Class :character   1st Qu.:  1280000    1st Qu.:   721.2   1st Qu.:1384      \n Mode  :character   Median :  1660000    Median :   990.3   Median :1762      \n                    Mean   :  2143286    Mean   :  1191.6   Mean   :1852      \n                    3rd Qu.:  2320000    3rd Qu.:  1302.4   3rd Qu.:2260      \n                    Max.   :392180000    Max.   :144883.4   Max.   :5756      \n                                                                              \n  Sale Date           Address          Type of Sale       Type of Area      \n Length:26806       Length:26806       Length:26806       Length:26806      \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n   Area (SQM)      Unit Price ($ PSM) Nett Price($)      Property Type     \n Min.   :   30.0   Min.   : 1484      Length:26806       Length:26806      \n 1st Qu.:   67.0   1st Qu.:14893      Class :character   Class :character  \n Median :   92.0   Median :18966      Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n Mean   :  110.5   Mean   :19930                                           \n 3rd Qu.:  121.0   3rd Qu.:24327                                           \n Max.   :13460.0   Max.   :61962                                           \n NA's   :6                                                                 \n Number of Units     Tenure          Completion Date   \n Min.   : 1.000   Length:26806       Length:26806      \n 1st Qu.: 1.000   Class :character   Class :character  \n Median : 1.000   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n Mean   : 1.005                                        \n 3rd Qu.: 1.000                                        \n Max.   :60.000                                        \n                                                       \n Purchaser Address Indicator Postal Code        Postal District   \n Length:26806                Length:26806       Length:26806      \n Class :character            Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character            Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                                                  \n                                                                  \n                                                                  \n                                                                  \n Postal Sector      Planning Region    Planning Area        Quarter         \n Length:26806       Length:26806       Length:26806       Length:26806      \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n# data summary\nsummary(df)\n\n\n\n\nFrom the continuous data above, we can conclude that there is a possibility of extreme outliers.

These en bloc cases are likely sales to companies for purpose of redevelopment rather than individual purchasers. See this link on the Meyer Park en bloc transaction. Otherwise, those 7 cases of transactions with more than one unit sold should be included as are likely the cases of purchase of multiple units or the purchase of multiple adjacent plots of land.\n\n\n\nFor the follow code chunk, we aim to remove all the enbloc sales, including the 5 transactions that we have found in section 2.3. While we have no idea if there are more than 5 cases of en bloc sales, the follow code chunk will effectively remove all the rows with the string “ENBLOC” in Address column.\n\ndf.c &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  filter(!grepl('ENBLOC', df$Address))\ndf.c\n\n# A tibble: 26,801 × 22\n   `Project Name`      `Transacted Price ($)` `Area (SQFT)` `Unit Price ($ PSF)`\n   &lt;chr&gt;                                &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 THE REEF AT KING'S…                2317000          883.                 2625\n 2 URBAN TREASURES                    1823500          883.                 2066\n 3 NORTH GAIA                         1421112         1076.                 1320\n 4 NORTH GAIA                         1258112         1033.                 1218\n 5 PARC BOTANNIA                      1280000          872.                 1468\n 6 NANYANG PARK                       5870000         3323.                 1767\n 7 PALMS @ SIXTH AVEN…                4950000         4521.                 1095\n 8 N.A.                               3260000         1555.                 2096\n 9 WHISTLER GRAND                      850000          441.                 1926\n10 NORTHOAKS                          1268000         1604.                  791\n# ℹ 26,791 more rows\n# ℹ 18 more variables: `Sale Date` &lt;chr&gt;, Address &lt;chr&gt;, `Type of Sale` &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   `Type of Area` &lt;chr&gt;, `Area (SQM)` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Unit Price ($ PSM)` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Nett Price($)` &lt;chr&gt;, `Property Type` &lt;chr&gt;, `Number of Units` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Tenure &lt;chr&gt;, `Completion Date` &lt;chr&gt;, `Purchaser Address Indicator` &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   `Postal Code` &lt;chr&gt;, `Postal District` &lt;chr&gt;, `Postal Sector` &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   `Planning Region` &lt;chr&gt;, `Planning Area` &lt;chr&gt;, Quarter &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nIn the df.c tibble, it showed that 5 rows had been removed. Now there is only 26,801 rows instead of the original 26,806 rows in the initial df. This confirm that there are only 5 en bloc sales in the data frame.\n\n\n\nAfter removing the 5 en bloc sales, we are still left with 7 transactions that has between 2 to 4 units sold per transaction. This has caused the Transacted Price ($) to be greatly inflated. In dealing with this, we can (1) choose to divide the Transacted Price ($) by the number of units sold, or (2) remove them from the analysis. In this analysis, we will be using method (2), to remove these transactions from the data set for further analysis. The reason to do so is that we cannot determine at this stage that each unit in the sales are equally priced, or whether each unit has the same Area size.\n\ndf.c &lt;- df.c %&gt;%\n  filter(`Number of Units` &lt;= 1)\n\n\n\n\nLand vs. Strata\nTo lend some background context, you can refer to this link: Landed vs. Strata Landed Basically, Strata means you only owns the property build on this land, but do not own the land itself. Land means you own the land and have more freedom and responsibility in terms of the constructions etc. The application of this knowledge for analysis is that Strata and Land classification can be identify as the sub-markets as owning a piece of land is likely to be more expensive for the purchaser compared to Strata title.\nThe plot below shows the 10 sub-markets in Singapore private housing market.\nLand\n\nApartment\nDetached House\nSemi-Detached House\nTerrace House\n\nStrata\n\nApartment\nCondominium\nDetached House\nExecutive Condominium\nSemi-Detached House\nTerrace House\n\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf.c %&gt;%\n  select(`Transacted Price ($)`, `Type of Area`, `Property Type`) %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Property Type`, `Type of Area`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(`Median Transaction Price ($)` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, .groups = 'drop')) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = `Property Type`, \n             y = `Median Transaction Price ($)`, \n             color = `Type of Area`)) +  # Adding color aesthetic based on Type of Area\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_economist() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  labs(color = \"Type of Area\")\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nFrom the Median Transacted Price plot above, we observe that the 10 sub-markets are distinct in pricing, with Land Type of Area generally priced a lot higher than Strata, especially in the Apartment and Detached House categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we would want to focus on the Apartment(Strata) Condominium and Executive Condominium sub-market in Singapore, out of the 10 sub-markets identified in section 2.3.3. As stated in section 1.1 Setting the scene, for families with monthly household income more than S$14,000, they need to turn to the private residential market. However, due limited number of plots to be shown, we will take Condominium as example for the illustrations\nAssumptions and considerations for the selecting the sub-markets to visualise:\n\nAffordability - According to the this article, apartment(Strata), Executive Condominium and Condominium are the next most affordable type of private housing if the family is not eligible to purchase public housing. This corroborate with the Median Transaction Price plot above.\nTarget Audience - The target audience for this graphics will be the public who would like to consider housing option in the private residential market. The target audience are those who’s family household are above the limits and would like to look for relatively affordable housing option in the private residential market as mentioned above in point 1.\nInformation Required - Pricing, Location, Types of Sales, Unit Price, Size of Property\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot 1: Pricing for non-freehold Condominium\nThis first plot focus on Condominium that are not of Freehold Tenure. Compared to freehold property, these non-freehold Condominiums are relatively lower price. The plot below shows the distribution of Transacted Price ($) in the five Planning Region in Singapore, and reveal the median price of each region varies from 1 to 2 million, with North Region with a tighter spread at a lower price than the other four regions. The Central Region has the highest median at 2 million, with a widest spread. The 4th quantile of the Central Region consists of Transacted Price ($) between 2.5 to just after 9 million. This shows that the Condominiums with Lease are more affordable in the North and East Region in Singapore, with North East and West Region next, and finally the most expensive Condominium would be the ones found in Central Region.\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf.c %&gt;%\n  filter(`Type of Area` == 'Strata',`Property Type` == 'Condominium', `Quarter` == '24Q1', `Tenure`!= 'Freehold') %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = `Transacted Price ($)`,\n           y = `Planning Region`,\n           fill = factor(stat(quantile))\n           )) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE,\n    quantiles = 4,\n    quantile_lines = TRUE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = \"Quartiles\",\n                       option = \"A\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(name = \"Transacted Price in million ($)\",\n    labels = c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10), \n    breaks = c(0,1000000,2000000,3000000,4000000,5000000,6000000,7000000,8000000,9000000,10000000)) +\n  theme_economist() + \n  ggtitle(\"24Q1 Non-Freehold Condo Transacted Price by Planning Region\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=12))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot 2: Mean and Median Unit Price for non-freehold Condominium\nPlot 2 focus on the mean and median Unit Price ($ PSF) for the non-freehold Condominium in the Central Region. The Mean Unit Price ($ PSF) is represented by the red dot in each of the violin plot and boxplot. While we see a slight rise in the mean and median Unit Price ($ PSF) in 23Q2, where there are more transactions with Unit Price ($ PSF) in the $2,500 range, represented by the bulge at the top of the violin plot. For the rest of the quarters, the mean and median Unit Price ($ PSF) hovers around the range of $2,000. Despite the mean and median are at $2,000 for the 24Q1, there is also a sizable transaction of Unit Price ($ PSF) of $3,000 happening in 24Q1, as represented by the slight bulge at the top of the violin plot.\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nquarter_means &lt;- df.c %&gt;%\n  filter(`Property Type` == 'Condominium',`Planning Region` == \"Central Region\", `Tenure`!= 'Freehold') %&gt;%\n  group_by(Quarter) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_uprice = mean(`Unit Price ($ PSF)`))\n\ndf.c %&gt;%\n  filter(`Property Type` == 'Condominium', `Planning Region` == \"Central Region\",`Tenure`!= 'Freehold') %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(y=`Unit Price ($ PSF)`,\n           x=`Quarter`)\n       )+\n  geom_violin() +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  geom_point(data = quarter_means, \n             aes(y = mean_uprice), \n             color = \"red\", \n             size = 3) +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  theme_economist() +\n  ggtitle(\"Condominium Unit Price ($ PSF) for Central Region\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot 3: Purchaser Address Indicator for non-freehold Condominium\nPlot 3 focus on the top and bottom 5% of the different types of purchasers for non-freehold Condominium in the Central Region. We assume that the N.A type are purchasers who do not own any property in Singapore. The top 5% of the Private category purchase units priced at $4.5-$9 million. For HDB and N.A categories, the top 5% are purchasing units that is priced between $3 to 4 million. Both bottom 5% Private and HDB categories purchase unit of $1 million, while the bottom 5% N.A category are buying unit just above $1 million. The plausible reason is that purchaser in N.A. category may want to buy a unit for their own stay since they do not own any other properties. Hence, they are paying slightly more for a larger unit relative to other two types of purchasers, who might be buying studio units for rental income.\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf.c %&gt;%\n  filter(`Property Type` == 'Condominium', `Quarter` == '24Q1', `Planning Region` == \"Central Region\", `Tenure` != 'Freehold') %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = `Transacted Price ($)`, \n           y = `Purchaser Address Indicator`, \n           fill = factor(stat(quantile))\n           )) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE, \n    quantiles = c(0.05, 0.95)\n    ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    name = \"Percentage of Total\",\n    values = c(\"#FF00FFA0\", \"#FFE4E1A0\", \"#0000ffA0\"),\n    labels = c(\"Bottom 5%\", \"5-95%\", \"Top 5%\")\n  ) +\n  theme_ridges()+\n  theme_economist() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=12)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name = \"Transacted Price in million ($)\",\n    labels = c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15), \n    breaks = c(0,1000000,2000000,3000000,4000000,5000000,6000000,7000000,8000000,9000000,10000000,11000000, 12000000, 13000000, 14000000, 15000000)) + \n  ggtitle(\"Central Region Condominium: Purchaser Address Indicator 24Q1\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

For example, I can choose to fill in the order for Purchaser Address Indicator as Private category is higher order than HDB category. The context is purchaser that address is Private is likely to be a person with higher Social Economic Status (SES) compared to a purchaser with HDB as address. Same could be applied to Postal Code, Postal District, Postal Sector, Planning Region and Planning Area.\nSpecial Case: Tenure is still a character data type as of now. If we choose to use this column for analysis, we do need to do data preparation on this. Tenure date could also be classified under continuous data for more granularity. This variable will be a mixture of nominal data type with categories like “Freehold”, and also quantitative data type using its Tenure date.\nNett Price($) is still a character data type as of now. If we choose to use this column for analysis, we do need to do data preparation on this.\nSpecial Case: Completion Date is classified as character, but a quick look at the data df, we will realise that this variable is a mix of quantitative and qualitative data type of Uncomplete and actual date of completion, which could be converted and analyse as doubles.\n\nFor simplicity of data analysis\n1. Transacted Price ($) and Nett Price($) are similar. In this analysis, we will use Transacted Price ($) for simplicity, as Nett Price($) has fair amount of missing data, and it is prices after deducting the value of the indirect discounts or benefits, and not representative for all transactions.\n\nArea (SQFT) and Area (SQM), and Unit Price ($ PSF) and Unit Price ($ PSM) are similar measures in different unit. We will use Area (SQFT) and Unit Price ($ PSF)\n\nNext we look at the basic statistics of the current data using summary()\n\nThe OutputThe Code\n\n\n\n\n Project Name       Transacted Price ($)  Area (SQFT)       Unit Price ($ PSF)\n Length:26806       Min.   :   440000    Min.   :   322.9   Min.   : 138      \n Class :character   1st Qu.:  1280000    1st Qu.:   721.2   1st Qu.:1384      \n Mode  :character   Median :  1660000    Median :   990.3   Median :1762      \n                    Mean   :  2143286    Mean   :  1191.6   Mean   :1852      \n                    3rd Qu.:  2320000    3rd Qu.:  1302.4   3rd Qu.:2260      \n                    Max.   :392180000    Max.   :144883.4   Max.   :5756      \n                                                                              \n  Sale Date           Address          Type of Sale       Type of Area      \n Length:26806       Length:26806       Length:26806       Length:26806      \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n   Area (SQM)      Unit Price ($ PSM) Nett Price($)      Property Type     \n Min.   :   30.0   Min.   : 1484      Length:26806       Length:26806      \n 1st Qu.:   67.0   1st Qu.:14893      Class :character   Class :character  \n Median :   92.0   Median :18966      Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n Mean   :  110.5   Mean   :19930                                           \n 3rd Qu.:  121.0   3rd Qu.:24327                                           \n Max.   :13460.0   Max.   :61962                                           \n NA's   :6                                                                 \n Number of Units     Tenure          Completion Date   \n Min.   : 1.000   Length:26806       Length:26806      \n 1st Qu.: 1.000   Class :character   Class :character  \n Median : 1.000   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n Mean   : 1.005                                        \n 3rd Qu.: 1.000                                        \n Max.   :60.000                                        \n                                                       \n Purchaser Address Indicator Postal Code        Postal District   \n Length:26806                Length:26806       Length:26806      \n Class :character            Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character            Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                                                  \n                                                                  \n                                                                  \n                                                                  \n Postal Sector      Planning Region    Planning Area        Quarter         \n Length:26806       Length:26806       Length:26806       Length:26806      \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n# data summary\nsummary(df)\n\n\n\n\nFrom the continuous data above, we can conclude that there is a possibility of extreme outliers.

These en bloc cases are likely sales to companies for purpose of redevelopment rather than individual purchasers. See this link on the Meyer Park en bloc transaction. Otherwise, those 7 cases of transactions with more than one unit sold should be included as are likely the cases of purchase of multiple units or the purchase of multiple adjacent plots of land.\n\n\n\nFor the follow code chunk, we aim to remove all the enbloc sales, including the 5 transactions that we have found in section 2.3.

Now there is only 26,801 rows instead of the original 26,806 rows in the initial df. This confirm that there are only 5 en bloc sales in the data frame.\n\n\n\nAfter removing the 5 en bloc sales, we are still left with 7 transactions that has between 2 to 4 units sold per transaction. This has caused the Transacted Price ($) to be greatly inflated. In dealing with this, we can (1) choose to divide the Transacted Price ($) by the number of units sold, or (2) remove them from the analysis. In this analysis, we will be using method (2), to remove these transactions from the data set for further analysis. The reason to do so is that we cannot determine at this stage that each unit in the sales are equally priced, or whether each unit has the same Area size.\n\ndf.c &lt;- df.c %&gt;%\n  filter(`Number of Units` &lt;= 1)\n\n\n\n\nLand vs. Strata\nTo lend some background context, you can refer to this link: Landed vs. Strata Landed Basically, Strata means you only owns the property build on this land, but do not own the land itself. Land means you own the land and have more freedom and responsibility in terms of the constructions etc. The application of this knowledge for analysis is that Strata and Land classification can be identify as the sub-markets as owning a piece of land is likely to be more expensive for the purchaser compared to Strata title.\nThe plot below shows the 10 sub-markets in Singapore private housing market.\nLand\n\nApartment\nDetached House\nSemi-Detached House\nTerrace House\n\nStrata\n\nApartment\nCondominium\nDetached House\nExecutive Condominium\nSemi-Detached House\nTerrace House\n\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf.c %&gt;%\n  select(`Transacted Price ($)`, `Type of Area`, `Property Type`) %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Property Type`, `Type of Area`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(`Median Transaction Price ($)` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, .groups = 'drop')) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = `Property Type`, \n             y = `Median Transaction Price ($)`, \n             color = `Type of Area`)) +  # Adding color aesthetic based on Type of Area\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_economist() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  labs(color = \"Type of Area\")\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nFrom the Median Transacted Price plot above, we observe that the 10 sub-markets are distinct in pricing, with Land Type of Area generally priced a lot higher than Strata, especially in the Apartment and Detached House categories."

As stated in section 1.1 Setting the scene, for families with monthly household income more than S$14,000, they need to turn to the private residential market. However, due limited number of plots to be shown, we will take Condominium as example for the illustrations\nAssumptions and considerations for the selecting the sub-markets to visualise:\n\nAffordability - According to the this article, apartment(Strata), Executive Condominium and Condominium are the next most affordable type of private housing if the family is not eligible to purchase public housing. This corroborate with the Median Transaction Price plot above.\nTarget Audience - The target audience for this graphics will be the public who would like to consider housing option in the private residential market. The target audience are those who’s family household are above the limits and would like to look for relatively affordable housing option in the private residential market as mentioned above in point 1.\nInformation Required - Pricing, Location, Types of Sales, Unit Price, Size of Property"

These en bloc cases are likely sales to companies for purpose of redevelopment rather than individual purchasers. See this link on the Meyer Park en bloc transaction. Otherwise, those 7 cases of transactions with more than one unit sold should be included as are likely the cases of purchase of multiple units or the purchase of multiple adjacent plots of land.\nTo lend some background context, you can refer to this link: Landed vs. Strata Landed Basically, Strata means you only owns the property build on this land, but do not own the land itself. Land means you own the land and have more freedom and responsibility in terms of the constructions etc. The application of this knowledge for analysis is that Strata and Land classification can be identify as the sub-markets as owning a piece of land is likely to be more expensive for the purchaser compared to Strata title.\nLet’s take a quick look at distribution before any data wrangling:\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(y = `Transacted Price ($)`,            \n           x = `Property Type`)) +\n  geom_boxplot()+\n  facet_grid(~Quarter) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(1,6)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  theme_wsj() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data = df ,\n       aes(x = `Transacted Price ($)`,\n           y = Quarter,\n           fill = factor(stat(quantile))\n           )) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE,\n    quantiles = 4,\n    quantile_lines = TRUE) +\n  scale_fill_economist(name = \"Quartiles\") +\n  theme_ridges() +\n  facet_wrap(~`Property Type`,scales = \"free\") +\n  theme_economist() +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  filter(`Type of Area` == 'Land') %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x= `Quarter`,\n           fill = `Purchaser Address Indicator`)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_grid(~`Property Type`) +\n  theme_economist() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Land: No. of Transactions by Property Type\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  filter(`Type of Area` == 'Strata') %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x= `Quarter`,\n           fill = `Purchaser Address Indicator`)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~`Property Type`) +\n  theme_economist() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Strata: No. of Transactions by 'Property Type'\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome learning points from these plots:\n\nApartment, Condominium and Terrace House seems to be affected most by outliers. There are two extreme outliers for transactions in 23Q1 and they are the two en bloc sales with 60 and 47 units of condominium each. As mention, the 5 en bloc sales will be removed from the data set to enable meaningful analysis.\nNo. of transactions for Apartment classified under Type of Area as Land is low.There is no transaction of Condominium and Executive Condominium as these categories of Property Type are always strata for Type of Sale. The URA Methodology Miscellaneous tab explains some of the terminologies.\nNo. of transactions for Detached House, Semi-Detached House and Terrace House are low compared to the rest of the three categories.\nSub markets to focus on could be the following:\n\nFor Land Type of Sale: Detached House, Semi-Detached House, and Terrace House.\nFor Strata Type of Sale: Apartment, Condominium, and Executive Condominium.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we aim to clean the data set to ensure the usefulness and accuracy of the visualisation.\nThis is achieved by:\n\nRemoving outliers\nAppropriate categorisation of variables\nAdditions of new variables to add new dimensions to analysis"

    "text": "3.0 Visualising Distribution with Ridgeline Plot\nRidgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\nFigure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English score by class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote - Ridgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\n\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\n3.1 Plotting ridgeline graph: ggridges method\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, you will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = MATHS,\n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 2,\n    fill = lighten(\"#CC99FF\", 0.5),\n    color = \"black\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"Maths grades\",\n    expand = c(0,0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(3,3))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Varying fill colors along the x axis\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient(). Both geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(), except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill. For technical reasons, we can have changing fill colors or transparency but not both.\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = MATHS,\n           y = CLASS,\n           fill = stat(x))) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n  scale_fill_continuous(name = \"Scores\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"Maths grades\",\n    expand = c(0,0)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Mapping the probabilities directly onto colour\nBeside providing additional geom objects to support the need to plot ridgeline plot, ggridges package also provides a stat function called stat_density_ridges() that replaces stat_density() of ggplot2.\nFigure below is plotted by mapping the probabilities calculated by using stat(ecdf) which represent the empirical cumulative density function for the distribution of English score.\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = MATHS, \n           y = CLASS, \n           fill = 0.5 - abs(0.5-stat(ecdf)))) +\n  stat_density_ridges(geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\", \n                      calc_ecdf = TRUE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Tail probability\",\n                       direction = -1) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\nNote It is important include the argument calc_ecdf = TRUE in stat_density_ridges().\n\n\n3.4 Ridgeline plots with quantile lines\nBy using geom_density_ridges_gradient(), we can colour the ridgeline plot by quantile, via the calculated stat(quantile) aesthetic as shown in the figure below.\n\nThe Code\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = MATHS, \n           y = CLASS, \n           fill = factor(stat(quantile))\n           )) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE, \n    quantiles = 10,\n    quantile_lines = TRUE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = \"Quartiles\") +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\nInstead of using number to define the quantiles, we can also specify quantiles by cut points such as 5% and 95% tails to colour the ridgeline plot as shown in the figure below.\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = MATHS, \n           y = CLASS, \n           fill = factor(stat(quantile))\n           )) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE, \n    quantiles = c(0.05, 0.95)\n    ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    name = \"Probability\",\n    values = c(\"#FF00FFA0\", \"#FFE4E1A0\", \"#0000ffA0\"),\n    labels = c(\"(0, 0.05]\", \"(0.05, 0.95]\", \"(0.95, 1]\")\n  ) +\n  theme_ridges()"

    "text": "1.3.1 Plotting ridgeline graph: ggridges method\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, you will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH,\n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 2,\n    fill = lighten(\"#CC99FF\", 0.5),\n    color = \"black\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0,0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(3,3))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Varying fill colors along the x axis\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient(). Both geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(), except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill. For technical reasons, we can have changing fill colors or transparency but not both.\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH,\n           y = CLASS,\n           fill = stat(x))) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n  scale_fill_continuous(name = \"Scores\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0,0)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Mapping the probabilities directly onto colour\nBeside providing additional geom objects to support the need to plot ridgeline plot, ggridges package also provides a stat function called stat_density_ridges() that replaces stat_density() of ggplot2.\nFigure below is plotted by mapping the probabilities calculated by using stat(ecdf) which represent the empirical cumulative density function for the distribution of English score.\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = MATHS, \n           y = CLASS, \n           fill = 0.5 - abs(0.5-stat(ecdf)))) +\n  stat_density_ridges(geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\", \n                      calc_ecdf = TRUE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Tail probability\",\n                       direction = -1) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\nNote It is important include the argument calc_ecdf = TRUE in stat_density_ridges().\n\n\n9.3.4 Ridgeline plots with quantile lines\nBy using geom_density_ridges_gradient(), we can colour the ridgeline plot by quantile, via the calculated stat(quantile) aesthetic as shown in the figure below.\n\nThe Code\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = MATHS, \n           y = CLASS, \n           fill = factor(stat(quantile))\n           )) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE, \n    quantiles = 10,\n    quantile_lines = TRUE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = \"Quartiles\") +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\nInstead of using number to define the quantiles, we can also specify quantiles by cut points such as 5% and 95% tails to colour the ridgeline plot as shown in the figure below.\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS, \n           fill = factor(stat(quantile))\n           )) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE, \n    quantiles = c(0.05, 0.95)\n    ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    name = \"Probability\",\n    values = c(\"#FF00FFA0\", \"#FFE4E1A0\", \"#0000ffA0\"),\n    labels = c(\"(0, 0.05]\", \"(0.05, 0.95]\", \"(0.95, 1]\")\n  ) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS, \n           fill = factor(stat(quantile))\n           )) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE, \n    quantiles = c(0.05, 0.95)\n    ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    name = \"Probability\",\n    values = c(\"#FF00FFA0\", \"#FFE4E1A0\", \"#0000ffA0\"),\n    labels = c(\"(0, 0.05]\", \"(0.05, 0.95]\", \"(0.95, 1]\")\n  ) +\n  theme_ridges()"

    "text": "4.0 Visualising Distribution with Raincloud Plot\nRaincloud Plot is a data visualisation techniques that produces a half-density to a distribution plot. It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of Maths score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\n4.1 Plotting a Half Eye graph\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\nThis produces a Half Eye visualisation, which is contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\nThe PlotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = MATHS)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Adding the boxplot with geom_boxplot()\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using geom_boxplot() of ggplot2. This produces a narrow boxplot. We reduce the width and adjust the opacity.\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = MATHS)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Adding the Dot Plots with stat_dots()\nNext, we will add the third geometry layer using stat_dots() of ggdist package. This produces a half-dotplot, which is similar to a histogram that indicates the number of samples (number of dots) in each bin. We select side = “left” to indicate we want it on the left-hand side.\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = MATHS)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4 Finishing Touch\nLastly, coord_flip() of ggplot2 package will be used to flip the raincloud chart horizontally to give it the raincloud appearance. At the same time, theme_wsj() of ggthemes package is used to give the raincloud chart a professional publishing standard look.\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = MATHS)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 2) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_wsj()"

It sets a variety of options for brushing (i.e., highlighting) multiple plots. These options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk. In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document.

Compared to freehold property, these non-freehold Condominiums are relatively lower price. The plot below shows the distribution of Transacted Price ($) in the five Planning Region in Singapore, and reveal the median price of each region varies from 1 to 2 million, with North Region with a tighter spread at a lower price than the other four regions. The Central Region has the highest median at 2 million, with a widest spread. The 4th quantile of the Central Region consists of Transacted Price ($) between 2.5 to just after 9 million.

While we see a slight rise in the mean and median Unit Price ($ PSF) in 23Q2, where there are more transactions with Unit Price ($ PSF) in the $2,500 range, represented by the bulge at the top of the violin plot. For the rest of the quarters, the mean and median Unit Price ($ PSF) hovers around the range of $2,000. Despite the mean and median are at $2,000 for the 24Q1, there is also a sizable transaction of Unit Price ($ PSF) of $3,000 happening in 24Q1, as represented by the slight bulge at the top of the violin plot.\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nquarter_means &lt;- df.c %&gt;%\n  filter(`Property Type` == 'Condominium',`Planning Region` == \"Central Region\", `Tenure`!= 'Freehold') %&gt;%\n  group_by(Quarter) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_uprice = mean(`Unit Price ($ PSF)`))\n\ndf.c %&gt;%\n  filter(`Property Type` == 'Condominium', `Planning Region` == \"Central Region\",`Tenure`!= 'Freehold') %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(y=`Unit Price ($ PSF)`,\n           x=`Quarter`)\n       )+\n  geom_violin() +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  geom_point(data = quarter_means, \n             aes(y = mean_uprice), \n             color = \"red\", \n             size = 3) +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  theme_economist() +\n  ggtitle(\"Condominium Unit Price ($ PSF) for Central Region\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot 3: Purchaser Address Indicator for non-freehold Condominium\nPlot 3 focus on the top and bottom 5% of the different types of purchasers for non-freehold Condominium in the Central Region. We assume that the N.A type are purchasers who do not own any property in Singapore. The top 5% of the Private category purchase units priced at $4.5-$9 million. For HDB and N.A categories, the top 5% are purchasing units that is priced between $3 to 4 million. Both bottom 5% Private and HDB categories purchase unit of $1 million, while the bottom 5% N.A category are buying unit just above $1 million. The plausible reason is that purchaser in N.A. category may want to buy a unit for their own stay since they do not own any other properties. Hence, they are paying slightly more for a larger unit relative to other two types of purchasers, who might be buying studio units for rental income.\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf.c %&gt;%\n  filter(`Property Type` == 'Condominium', `Quarter` == '24Q1', `Planning Region` == \"Central Region\", `Tenure` != 'Freehold') %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = `Transacted Price ($)`, \n           y = `Purchaser Address Indicator`, \n           fill = factor(stat(quantile))\n           )) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE, \n    quantiles = c(0.05, 0.95)\n    ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    name = \"Percentage of Total\",\n    values = c(\"#FF00FFA0\", \"#FFE4E1A0\", \"#0000ffA0\"),\n    labels = c(\"Bottom 5%\", \"5-95%\", \"Top 5%\")\n  ) +\n  theme_ridges()+\n  theme_economist() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=12)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name = \"Transacted Price in million ($)\",\n    labels = c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15), \n    breaks = c(0,1000000,2000000,3000000,4000000,5000000,6000000,7000000,8000000,9000000,10000000,11000000, 12000000, 13000000, 14000000, 15000000)) + \n  ggtitle(\"Central Region Condominium: Purchaser Address Indicator 24Q1\")"

This implies that while the East Region has properties with moderate unit prices, it does not reach as high of a price point as frequently as the Central Region.\n\nNorth East and North Regions peaks are less sharp and positioned towards the lower end of the price scale, suggesting a more affordable housing options and a wider distribution of unit prices. North Region appears to have a slightly broader distribution than North East.\n\nWest Region has the lowest peak among all the regions and is positioned towards the far left of the plot. This indicates that the West Region is the most affordable in Singapore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe overall color scheme is pleasing to the eyes, but having the whole distribution of the same region in the same color may not have captured the spread/distributed as mentioned in the insights: “West Region has the lowest peak among all the regions and is positioned towards the far left of the plot. This indicates that the West Region is the most affordable in Singapore.” While the peak of the respective region does indicate the highest frequency of data points , it does not reveal the overall median price and other aspect such as the the 4 quantiles. Hence, it might be easier for the audience if quantiles were included in the aesthetics of the plot. With this enhancement, it might be easier to define which Region is more affordable, rather than just saying that West is most affordable as it is “most far left”.\n\nThe legend for the Planning Region to the right of the plot is redundant, as it is very clear from the y-axis which plot belongs to which region. If we choose to retain the legend, perhaps it could be compressed slightly smaller to the top right corner of the plot (as there are ample empty space between the 4000-6000 mark along x-axis), and the free up spaces could be used to insert another plot that enhance the story-telling for this plot.\n\nThe current distribution is 100% opaque and parts of the North Region graph is overlapping the West Region. While the peak of the West Region is still visible, it could be better for audience if the distribution is slightly transparent to allow the audience to see the full distribution of the West Region. It will be complementing the enhancement with quantiles added, as by adjusting the transparency, we will be able to see all the quantiles without guessing through the overlapped areas.\n\n\n\n\nAs most of the distribution in this plot falls between the $1,000-$3,000 mark along the x-axis, the current axis ticks did not allow the audience to have a clear sense of where the peaks are, except for a rough sense of gauging the peak from the neares two x-axis ticks, which is 0 or 2000. To alleviate this issue, the frequency of the x-axis ticks could be increased. Also, visually the plot for the Central Region at the most right, seems to end at just below the 5,000 mark. Space could be saved by ending the x-axis ticks at 5,000 instead, without affecting the clarity and truthfulness of the plot.\n\nInstead of guessing from the distribution which Region is the most affordable and which is the highest priced, it would be clearer if we add in another plot with comparison of the exact mean and median price across the 5 regions using a horizontal bar chart to complement the existing plot.\n\nThe plot is able to let audience understand the overall comparison of distribution against the other 4 regions, but did not provide any comparison of each region against the overall median Unit Price in Singapore. To help audience understand the distribution with respect to the overall median, an overall median line for the Unit Price could be added. In this way, not only we put perspective of region against region, we also include the perspective of each region against the overall market in Singapore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. T.S.

    "text": "The overall color scheme is pleasing to the eyes, but having the whole distribution of the same region in the same color may not have captured the spread/distributed as mentioned in the insights: “West Region has the lowest peak among all the regions and is positioned towards the far left of the plot. This indicates that the West Region is the most affordable in Singapore.” While the peak of the respective region does indicate the highest frequency of data points , it does not reveal the overall median price and other aspect such as the the 4 quantiles. Hence, it might be easier for the audience if quantiles were included in the aesthetics of the plot. With this enhancement, it might be easier to define which Region is more affordable, rather than just saying that West is most affordable as it is “most far left”.\n\nThe legend for the Planning Region to the right of the plot is redundant, as it is very clear from the y-axis which plot belongs to which region. If we choose to retain the legend, perhaps it could be compressed slightly smaller to the top right corner of the plot (as there are ample empty space between the 4000-6000 mark along x-axis), and the free up spaces could be used to insert another plot that enhance the story-telling for this plot.\n\nThe current distribution is 100% opaque and parts of the North Region graph is overlapping the West Region. While the peak of the West Region is still visible, it could be better for audience if the distribution is slightly transparent to allow the audience to see the full distribution of the West Region. It will be complementing the enhancement with quantiles added, as by adjusting the transparency, we will be able to see all the quantiles without guessing through the overlapped areas.\n\n\n\n\nAs most of the distribution in this plot falls between the $1,000-$3,000 mark along the x-axis, the current axis ticks did not allow the audience to have a clear sense of where the peaks are, except for a rough sense of gauging the peak from the neares two x-axis ticks, which is 0 or 2000. To alleviate this issue, the frequency of the x-axis ticks could be increased. Also, visually the plot for the Central Region at the most right, seems to end at just below the 5,000 mark. Space could be saved by ending the x-axis ticks at 5,000 instead, without affecting the clarity and truthfulness of the plot.\n\nInstead of guessing from the distribution which Region is the most affordable and which is the highest priced, it would be clearer if we add in another plot with comparison of the exact mean and median price across the 5 regions using a horizontal bar chart to complement the existing plot.\n\nThe plot is able to let audience understand the overall comparison of distribution against the other 4 regions, but did not provide any comparison of each region against the overall median Unit Price in Singapore. To help audience understand the distribution with respect to the overall median, an overall median line for the Unit Price could be added. In this way, not only we put perspective of region against region, we also include the perspective of each region against the overall market in Singapore."
