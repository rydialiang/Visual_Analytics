You can refer to the FAQ, Data Dictionary and Methodology in URA website.\nQualitative\n1. Nominal: Project Name, Address, Type of Sale,\n2. Ordinal: Type of Area, Property Type, Sales Date, Purchaser Address Indicator, Postal Code, Postal District, Postal Sector, Planning Region, Planning Area and Quarter.\nSome of the variables I have classified under ordinal are contextual. For example, I can choose to fill in the order for Purchaser Address Indicator as Private category is higher order than HDB category. The context is purchaser that address is Private is likely to be a person with higher Social Economic Status (SES) compared to a purchaser with HDB as address. Same could be applied to Postal Code, Postal District, Postal Sector, Planning Region and Planning Area.\nQuantitative\n3. Discrete: Number of Units and Tenure. Note that Tenure is still a chr data type as of now. If we choose to use this column for analysis, we do need to do data preparation on this. Tenure could also be classified under continuous data for more granularity.\n4. Continuous: Transacted Price ($),Area (SQFT), Unit Price ($ PSF), Area (SQM), Unit Price ($ PSM), and Nett Price($). Note that Nett Price($) is still a chr data type as of now. If we choose to use this column for analysis, we do need to do data preparation on this.\nSpecial Case: Completion Date is classified as chr, but a quick look at the data df, we will realise that this variable is a mix of quantitative and qualitative data type of Uncomplete and actual date of completion, which could be converted and analyse as doubles.\nSome important observations: 1. Transacted Price ($) and Nett Price($) are similar. In this analysis, we will use Transacted Price ($) for simplicity, as Nett Price($) has fair amount of missing data, and it is prices after deducting the value of the indirect discounts or benefits, and not representive for all transactions. 1. Area (SQFT) and Area (SQM), and Unit Price ($ PSF) and Unit Price ($ PSM) are similar measures in different unit. We will use Area (SQFT) and Unit Price ($ PSF)\nNext we look at the basic statistics of the current data using summary()\n\nThe OutputThe Code\n\n\n\n\n Project Name       Transacted Price ($)  Area (SQFT)       Unit Price ($ PSF)\n Length:26806       Min.   :   440000    Min.   :   322.9   Min.   : 138      \n Class :character   1st Qu.:  1280000    1st Qu.:   721.2   1st Qu.:1384      \n Mode  :character   Median :  1660000    Median :   990.3   Median :1762      \n                    Mean   :  2143286    Mean   :  1191.6   Mean   :1852      \n                    3rd Qu.:  2320000    3rd Qu.:  1302.4   3rd Qu.:2260      \n                    Max.   :392180000    Max.   :144883.4   Max.   :5756      \n                                                                              \n  Sale Date           Address          Type of Sale       Type of Area      \n Length:26806       Length:26806       Length:26806       Length:26806      \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n   Area (SQM)      Unit Price ($ PSM) Nett Price($)      Property Type     \n Min.   :   30.0   Min.   : 1484      Length:26806       Length:26806      \n 1st Qu.:   67.0   1st Qu.:14893      Class :character   Class :character  \n Median :   92.0   Median :18966      Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n Mean   :  110.5   Mean   :19930                                           \n 3rd Qu.:  121.0   3rd Qu.:24327                                           \n Max.   :13460.0   Max.   :61962                                           \n NA's   :6                                                                 \n Number of Units     Tenure          Completion Date   \n Min.   : 1.000   Length:26806       Length:26806      \n 1st Qu.: 1.000   Class :character   Class :character  \n Median : 1.000   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n Mean   : 1.005                                        \n 3rd Qu.: 1.000                                        \n Max.   :60.000                                        \n                                                       \n Purchaser Address Indicator Postal Code        Postal District   \n Length:26806                Length:26806       Length:26806      \n Class :character            Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character            Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                                                  \n                                                                  \n                                                                  \n                                                                  \n Postal Sector      Planning Region    Planning Area        Quarter         \n Length:26806       Length:26806       Length:26806       Length:26806      \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n# data summary\nsummary(df)\n\n\n\n\nFrom the continuous data above, we can conclude that there is a possibility of extreme outliers.

Land means you own the land and have more freedom and responsibility in terms of the constructions etc. The application of this knowledge for analysis is that Strata and Land classification can be identify as the sub-markets as owning a piece of land is likely to be more expensive for the purchaser compared to Strata title.\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  filter(`Type of Area` == 'Land') %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x= `Quarter`,\n           fill = `Purchaser Address Indicator`)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_grid(~`Property Type`) +\n  theme_economist() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Land: No. of Transactions by Property Type\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  filter(`Type of Area` == 'Strata') %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x= `Quarter`,\n           fill = `Purchaser Address Indicator`)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~`Property Type`) +\n  theme_economist() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Strata: No. of Transactions by 'Property Type'\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo understand which Type of Area has high market value by Transacted Price ($):\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  select(`Transacted Price ($)`,`Type of Area`) %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Type of Area`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(`Total Transaction Price ($)` = sum(`Transacted Price ($)`), `Mean Transaction Price ($)` = mean(`Transacted Price ($)`), `Median Transaction Price ($)` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  `Type of Area` `Total Transaction Price ($)` `Mean Transaction Price ($)`\n  &lt;chr&gt;                                  &lt;dbl&gt;                        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Land                              9051931648                     5765562.\n2 Strata                           48400988508                     1917934.\n# ℹ 1 more variable: `Median Transaction Price ($)` &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nDiving a bit deeper.We segregate them by Property Type\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  select(`Transacted Price ($)`,`Type of Area`, `Property Type`) %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Property Type`, `Type of Area`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(`Median Transaction Price ($)` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`))\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 3\n# Groups:   Property Type [6]\n   `Property Type`       `Type of Area` `Median Transaction Price ($)`\n   &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;chr&gt;                                   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Apartment             Land                                  6670000\n 2 Apartment             Strata                                1699394\n 3 Condominium           Strata                                1650000\n 4 Detached House        Land                                 11050000\n 5 Detached House        Strata                                4800000\n 6 Executive Condominium Strata                                1400000\n 7 Semi-Detached House   Land                                  5700000\n 8 Semi-Detached House   Strata                                3735000\n 9 Terrace House         Land                                  3705000\n10 Terrace House         Strata                                3038000\n\n\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  select(`Transacted Price ($)`,`Type of Area`, `Property Type`) %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Property Type`,`Type of Area`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(`Median Transaction Price ($)` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, .groups = 'drop')) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(y = `Median Transaction Price ($)`,\n             x = `Property Type`)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome learning points from these plots and tibbles:\n\nApartment, Condominium and Terrace House seems to be affected most by outliers. There are two extreme outliers for transactions in 23Q1 and they are the two en bloc sales with 60 and 47 units of condominium each. As mention, the 5 en bloc sales will be removed from the data set to enable meaningful analysis.\nNo. of transactions for Apartment classified under Type of Area as Land is low.There is no transaction of Condominium and Executive Condominium as these categories of Property Type are always strata for Type of Sale. The URA Methodology Miscellaneous tab explains some of the terminologies.\nNo. of transactions for Detached House, Semi-Detached House and Terrace House are low compared to the rest of the three categories.\nSub markets to focus on based on the number of transactions could be the following lists.\n\nFor Land Type of Sale: Detached House, Semi-Detached House, and Terrace House.\nFor Strata Type of Sale: Apartment, Condominium, and Executive Condominium.\n\nHowever, we should also note that we can prioritise the sub-market for analysis based on the total, mean and median Transaction Price ($) in each category (Land and Strata) instead of just looking at volume of transactions. In the Type of Area with Total of Transacted Price ($) tibbles above, we see that Land type transaction low in volume, the total transactions in the 5 quarters is about 1/5 the total transactions of Stata type sales. However, when we look at the mean and median Transacted Price ($), we observe that mean and median Transaction Price ($) Land type is roughly 3 times of Strata type.\n\nThis mean that Land type has low volume for number of transactions but generally higher average Transacted Price ($).\nFor Strata type, it has high volume but lower average Transacted Price ($).\n\nLastly, the scatter plot of median Transaction Price ($) suggest that there is a difference in the median price for the same Property Type with different Type of Area. Hence, the should study each of this sub-markets individually.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we aim to clean the data set to ensure the usefulness and accuracy of the visualisation.\nThis is achieved by:\n\nRemoving irrelevant data and outliers\nAppropriate categorisation of variables\nAdditions of new variables to add new dimensions to analysis\n\n\n\n\nFor the follow code chunk, we aim to remove all the enbloc sales, including the 5 transactions that we have found in section 2.3. While we have no idea if there are more than 5 cases of en bloc sales, the follow code chunk will effectively remove all the rows with the string “ENBLOC” in Address column.\n\ndf.c &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  filter(!grepl('ENBLOC', df$Address))\ndf.c\n\n# A tibble: 26,801 × 22\n   `Project Name`      `Transacted Price ($)` `Area (SQFT)` `Unit Price ($ PSF)`\n   &lt;chr&gt;                                &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 THE REEF AT KING'S…                2317000          883.                 2625\n 2 URBAN TREASURES                    1823500          883.                 2066\n 3 NORTH GAIA                         1421112         1076.                 1320\n 4 NORTH GAIA                         1258112         1033.                 1218\n 5 PARC BOTANNIA                      1280000          872.                 1468\n 6 NANYANG PARK                       5870000         3323.                 1767\n 7 PALMS @ SIXTH AVEN…                4950000         4521.                 1095\n 8 N.A.                               3260000         1555.                 2096\n 9 WHISTLER GRAND                      850000          441.                 1926\n10 NORTHOAKS                          1268000         1604.                  791\n# ℹ 26,791 more rows\n# ℹ 18 more variables: `Sale Date` &lt;chr&gt;, Address &lt;chr&gt;, `Type of Sale` &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   `Type of Area` &lt;chr&gt;, `Area (SQM)` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Unit Price ($ PSM)` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Nett Price($)` &lt;chr&gt;, `Property Type` &lt;chr&gt;, `Number of Units` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Tenure &lt;chr&gt;, `Completion Date` &lt;chr&gt;, `Purchaser Address Indicator` &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   `Postal Code` &lt;chr&gt;, `Postal District` &lt;chr&gt;, `Postal Sector` &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   `Planning Region` &lt;chr&gt;, `Planning Area` &lt;chr&gt;, Quarter &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nIn the df.c tibble, it showed that 5 rows had been removed. Now there is only 26,801 rows instead of the original 26,806 rows in the initial df. This confirm that there are only 5 en bloc sales in the data frame.\n\n\n\nPreviously, we have identified the Sale Date as Ordinal quantitative variable largely because it is classified as chr type in R. However, when we apply the knowledge from Fundamentals of Data Visualization Chapter 2 and R for Visual Analytics Chapter 17 date or time in fact, can be treated as discrete or continuous data."

    "text": "There are two major residential property market in Singapore, namely public and private housing. Public housing aims to meet the basic need of the general public with monthly $14,000 for families/couples buying a new HDB flat. Singapore is a city-state with limited land resource. Housing, on the other hand, is one of the basic need of people of this city-state. In order to ensure that all citizen in the country can access to affordable housing, the government have initiated massive public housing programme since independent.\n\n\n\nAssuming the role of a graphical editor of a media company, you are requested to prepare minimum two and maximum three data visualisation to reveal the private residential market and sub-markets of Singapore for the 1st quarter of 2024."

You can refer to the FAQ, Data Dictionary and Methodology in URA website.\nQualitative\n1. Nominal: Project Name, Address, Type of Sale,\n2. Ordinal: Type of Area, Property Type, Sales Date, Purchaser Address Indicator, Postal Code, Postal District, Postal Sector, Planning Region, Planning Area and Quarter.\nSome of the variables I have classified under ordinal are contextual. For example, I can choose to fill in the order for Purchaser Address Indicator as Private category is higher order than HDB category. The context is purchaser that address is Private is likely to be a person with higher Social Economic Status (SES) compared to a purchaser with HDB as address. Same could be applied to Postal Code, Postal District, Postal Sector, Planning Region and Planning Area.\nQuantitative\n3. Discrete: Number of Units and Tenure. Note that Tenure is still a chr data type as of now. If we choose to use this column for analysis, we do need to do data preparation on this. Tenure could also be classified under continuous data for more granularity.\n4. Continuous: Transacted Price ($),Area (SQFT), Unit Price ($ PSF), Area (SQM), Unit Price ($ PSM), and Nett Price($). Note that Nett Price($) is still a chr data type as of now. If we choose to use this column for analysis, we do need to do data preparation on this.\nSpecial Case: Completion Date is classified as chr, but a quick look at the data df, we will realise that this variable is a mix of quantitative and qualitative data type of Uncomplete and actual date of completion, which could be converted and analyse as doubles.\nSome important observations: 1. Transacted Price ($) and Nett Price($) are similar. In this analysis, we will use Transacted Price ($) for simplicity, as Nett Price($) has fair amount of missing data, and it is prices after deducting the value of the indirect discounts or benefits, and not representive for all transactions. 1. Area (SQFT) and Area (SQM), and Unit Price ($ PSF) and Unit Price ($ PSM) are similar measures in different unit. We will use Area (SQFT) and Unit Price ($ PSF)\nNext we look at the basic statistics of the current data using summary()\n\nThe OutputThe Code\n\n\n\n\n Project Name       Transacted Price ($)  Area (SQFT)       Unit Price ($ PSF)\n Length:26806       Min.   :   440000    Min.   :   322.9   Min.   : 138      \n Class :character   1st Qu.:  1280000    1st Qu.:   721.2   1st Qu.:1384      \n Mode  :character   Median :  1660000    Median :   990.3   Median :1762      \n                    Mean   :  2143286    Mean   :  1191.6   Mean   :1852      \n                    3rd Qu.:  2320000    3rd Qu.:  1302.4   3rd Qu.:2260      \n                    Max.   :392180000    Max.   :144883.4   Max.   :5756      \n                                                                              \n  Sale Date           Address          Type of Sale       Type of Area      \n Length:26806       Length:26806       Length:26806       Length:26806      \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n   Area (SQM)      Unit Price ($ PSM) Nett Price($)      Property Type     \n Min.   :   30.0   Min.   : 1484      Length:26806       Length:26806      \n 1st Qu.:   67.0   1st Qu.:14893      Class :character   Class :character  \n Median :   92.0   Median :18966      Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n Mean   :  110.5   Mean   :19930                                           \n 3rd Qu.:  121.0   3rd Qu.:24327                                           \n Max.   :13460.0   Max.   :61962                                           \n NA's   :6                                                                 \n Number of Units     Tenure          Completion Date   \n Min.   : 1.000   Length:26806       Length:26806      \n 1st Qu.: 1.000   Class :character   Class :character  \n Median : 1.000   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n Mean   : 1.005                                        \n 3rd Qu.: 1.000                                        \n Max.   :60.000                                        \n                                                       \n Purchaser Address Indicator Postal Code        Postal District   \n Length:26806                Length:26806       Length:26806      \n Class :character            Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character            Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                                                  \n                                                                  \n                                                                  \n                                                                  \n Postal Sector      Planning Region    Planning Area        Quarter         \n Length:26806       Length:26806       Length:26806       Length:26806      \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n# data summary\nsummary(df)\n\n\n\n\nFrom the continuous data above, we can conclude that there is a possibility of extreme outliers.

Land means you own the land and have more freedom and responsibility in terms of the constructions etc. The application of this knowledge for analysis is that Strata and Land classification can be identify as the sub-markets as owning a piece of land is likely to be more expensive for the purchaser compared to Strata title.\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  filter(`Type of Area` == 'Land') %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x= `Quarter`,\n           fill = `Purchaser Address Indicator`)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_grid(~`Property Type`) +\n  theme_economist() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Land: No. of Transactions by Property Type\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  filter(`Type of Area` == 'Strata') %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x= `Quarter`,\n           fill = `Purchaser Address Indicator`)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~`Property Type`) +\n  theme_economist() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Strata: No. of Transactions by 'Property Type'\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo understand which Type of Area has high market value by Transacted Price ($):\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  select(`Transacted Price ($)`,`Type of Area`) %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Type of Area`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(`Total Transaction Price ($)` = sum(`Transacted Price ($)`), `Mean Transaction Price ($)` = mean(`Transacted Price ($)`), `Median Transaction Price ($)` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  `Type of Area` `Total Transaction Price ($)` `Mean Transaction Price ($)`\n  &lt;chr&gt;                                  &lt;dbl&gt;                        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Land                              9051931648                     5765562.\n2 Strata                           48400988508                     1917934.\n# ℹ 1 more variable: `Median Transaction Price ($)` &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nDiving a bit deeper.We segregate them by Property Type\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  select(`Transacted Price ($)`,`Type of Area`, `Property Type`) %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Property Type`, `Type of Area`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(`Median Transaction Price ($)` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`))\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 3\n# Groups:   Property Type [6]\n   `Property Type`       `Type of Area` `Median Transaction Price ($)`\n   &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;chr&gt;                                   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Apartment             Land                                  6670000\n 2 Apartment             Strata                                1699394\n 3 Condominium           Strata                                1650000\n 4 Detached House        Land                                 11050000\n 5 Detached House        Strata                                4800000\n 6 Executive Condominium Strata                                1400000\n 7 Semi-Detached House   Land                                  5700000\n 8 Semi-Detached House   Strata                                3735000\n 9 Terrace House         Land                                  3705000\n10 Terrace House         Strata                                3038000\n\n\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  select(`Transacted Price ($)`,`Type of Area`, `Property Type`) %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Property Type`,`Type of Area`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(`Median Transaction Price ($)` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, .groups = 'drop')) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(y = `Median Transaction Price ($)`,\n             x = `Property Type`)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome learning points from these plots and tibbles:\n\nApartment, Condominium and Terrace House seems to be affected most by outliers. There are two extreme outliers for transactions in 23Q1 and they are the two en bloc sales with 60 and 47 units of condominium each. As mention, the 5 en bloc sales will be removed from the data set to enable meaningful analysis.\nNo. of transactions for Apartment classified under Type of Area as Land is low.There is no transaction of Condominium and Executive Condominium as these categories of Property Type are always strata for Type of Sale. The URA Methodology Miscellaneous tab explains some of the terminologies.\nNo. of transactions for Detached House, Semi-Detached House and Terrace House are low compared to the rest of the three categories.\nSub markets to focus on based on the number of transactions could be the following lists.\n\nFor Land Type of Sale: Detached House, Semi-Detached House, and Terrace House.\nFor Strata Type of Sale: Apartment, Condominium, and Executive Condominium.\n\nHowever, we should also note that we can prioritise the sub-market for analysis based on the total, mean and median Transaction Price ($) in each category (Land and Strata) instead of just looking at volume of transactions. In the Type of Area with Total of Transacted Price ($) tibbles above, we see that Land type transaction low in volume, the total transactions in the 5 quarters is about 1/5 the total transactions of Stata type sales. However, when we look at the mean and median Transacted Price ($), we observe that mean and median Transaction Price ($) Land type is roughly 3 times of Strata type.\n\nThis mean that Land type has low volume for number of transactions but generally higher average Transacted Price ($).\nFor Strata type, it has high volume but lower average Transacted Price ($).\n\nLastly, the scatter plot of median Transaction Price ($) suggest that there is a difference in the median price for the same Property Type with different Type of Area. Hence, the should study each of this sub-markets individually.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we aim to clean the data set to ensure the usefulness and accuracy of the visualisation.\nThis is achieved by:\n\nRemoving irrelevant data and outliers\nAppropriate categorisation of variables\nAdditions of new variables to add new dimensions to analysis\n\n\n\n\nFor the follow code chunk, we aim to remove all the enbloc sales, including the 5 transactions that we have found in section 2.3.

Otherwise, those 7 cases of transactions with more than one unit sold should be included as are likely the cases of purchase of multiple units or the purchase of multiple adjacent plots of land.\nTo lend some background context, you can refer to this link: Landed vs. Strata Landed Basically, Strata means you only owns the property build on this land, but do not own the land itself. Land means you own the land and have more freedom and responsibility in terms of the constructions etc. The application of this knowledge for analysis is that Strata and Land classification can be identify as the sub-markets as owning a piece of land is likely to be more expensive for the purchaser compared to Strata title.\nLet’s take a quick look at distribution before any data wrangling:\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(y = `Transacted Price ($)`,            \n           x = `Property Type`)) +\n  geom_boxplot()+\n  facet_grid(~Quarter) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(1,6)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  theme_wsj() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data = df ,\n       aes(x = `Transacted Price ($)`,\n           y = Quarter,\n           fill = factor(stat(quantile))\n           )) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE,\n    quantiles = 4,\n    quantile_lines = TRUE) +\n  scale_fill_economist(name = \"Quartiles\") +\n  theme_ridges() +\n  facet_wrap(~`Property Type`,scales = \"free\") +\n  theme_economist() +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  filter(`Type of Area` == 'Land') %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x= `Quarter`,\n           fill = `Purchaser Address Indicator`)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_grid(~`Property Type`) +\n  theme_economist() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Land: No. of Transactions by Property Type\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  filter(`Type of Area` == 'Strata') %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x= `Quarter`,\n           fill = `Purchaser Address Indicator`)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~`Property Type`) +\n  theme_economist() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Strata: No. of Transactions by 'Property Type'\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome learning points from these plots:\n\nApartment, Condominium and Terrace House seems to be affected most by outliers. There are two extreme outliers for transactions in 23Q1 and they are the two en bloc sales with 60 and 47 units of condominium each. As mention, the 5 en bloc sales will be removed from the data set to enable meaningful analysis.\nNo. of transactions for Apartment classified under Type of Area as Land is low.There is no transaction of Condominium and Executive Condominium as these categories of Property Type are always strata for Type of Sale. The URA Methodology Miscellaneous tab explains some of the terminologies.\nNo. of transactions for Detached House, Semi-Detached House and Terrace House are low compared to the rest of the three categories.\nSub markets to focus on could be the following:\n\nFor Land Type of Sale: Detached House, Semi-Detached House, and Terrace House.\nFor Strata Type of Sale: Apartment, Condominium, and Executive Condominium.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we aim to clean the data set to ensure the usefulness and accuracy of the visualisation.\nThis is achieved by:\n\nRemoving outliers\nAppropriate categorisation of variables\nAdditions of new variables to add new dimensions to analysis"

    "text": "3.0 Visualising Distribution with Ridgeline Plot\nRidgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\nFigure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English score by class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote - Ridgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\n\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\n3.1 Plotting ridgeline graph: ggridges method\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, you will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = MATHS,\n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 2,\n    fill = lighten(\"#CC99FF\", 0.5),\n    color = \"black\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"Maths grades\",\n    expand = c(0,0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(3,3))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Varying fill colors along the x axis\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient(). Both geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(), except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill.

    "text": "4.0 Visualising Distribution with Raincloud Plot\nRaincloud Plot is a data visualisation techniques that produces a half-density to a distribution plot. It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of Maths score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\n4.1 Plotting a Half Eye graph\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\nThis produces a Half Eye visualisation, which is contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\nThe PlotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = MATHS)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Adding the boxplot with geom_boxplot()\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using geom_boxplot() of ggplot2.

For Part I, we will focus on creating interactive data visualisation by using functions provided by ggiraph and plotly packages. For Part II, we will focus on learning how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, we will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package."
