Key idea is to create more elegant and effective statistical graphics, pleasing to the eyes of the reader, and reducing the cognitive load of the reader.\n\nKey learning:\n\n-   control the placement of annotation on a graph by using functions provided in ggrepel package\n\n-   create professional publication quality figure by using functions provided in ggthemes and hrbrthemes packages\n\n-   plot composite figure by combining ggplot2 graphs by using patchwork package.\n\n## 2 Getting started\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Installing and loading the required libraries\n\nIn this exercise, beside tidyverse, four R packages will be used. They are:\n\nggrepel: an R package provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels. ggthemes: an R package provides some extra themes, geoms, and scales for ‘ggplot2’. hrbrthemes: an R package provides typography-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2. patchwork: an R package for preparing composite figure created using ggplot2. Code chunk below will be used to check if these packages have been installed and also will load them onto your working R environment.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(ggrepel,patchwork,\n               ggthemes,hrbrthemes,\n               tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Importing data\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, a data file called Exam_data will be used. It consists of year end examination grades of a cohort of primary 3 students from a local school. It is in csv file format.\n\nThe code chunk below imports exam_data.csv into R environment by using [read_csv()](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) function of [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package. **readr** is one of the tidyverse package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexam_data <- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## glimpse() the Data\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(exam_data)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 322\nColumns: 7\n$ ID      <chr> \"Student321\", \"Student305\", \"Student289\", \"Student227\", \"Stude…\n$ CLASS   <chr> \"3I\", \"3I\", \"3H\", \"3F\", \"3I\", \"3I\", \"3I\", \"3I\", \"3I\", \"3H\", \"3…\n$ GENDER  <chr> \"Male\", \"Female\", \"Male\", \"Male\", \"Male\", \"Female\", \"Male\", \"M…\n$ RACE    <chr> \"Malay\", \"Malay\", \"Chinese\", \"Chinese\", \"Malay\", \"Malay\", \"Chi…\n$ ENGLISH <dbl> 21, 24, 26, 27, 27, 31, 31, 31, 33, 34, 34, 36, 36, 36, 37, 38…\n$ MATHS   <dbl> 9, 22, 16, 77, 11, 16, 21, 18, 19, 49, 39, 35, 23, 36, 49, 30,…\n$ SCIENCE <dbl> 15, 16, 16, 31, 25, 16, 25, 27, 15, 37, 42, 22, 32, 36, 35, 45…\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nThere are a total of seven attributes in the exam_data tibble data frame. Four of them are categorical data type and the other three are in continuous data type.\n\n-   Categorical attributes: ID, CLASS, GENDER and RACE.\n\n-   Continuous attributes: MATHS, ENGLISH and SCIENCE.\n:::\n\n## 3 Beyond ggplot2 Annotation: ggrepel\nAnnotation for large number of data points is potentially challenging, as the annotations may overwhelm the plot. \n\n::: panel-tabset\n## The plot\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## The code\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              linewidth=0.5) +  \n  geom_label(aes(label = ID), \n             hjust = .5, \n             vjust = -.5) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n",
