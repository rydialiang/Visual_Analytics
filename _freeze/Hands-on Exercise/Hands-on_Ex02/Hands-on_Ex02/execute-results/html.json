Key idea is to create more elegant and effective statistical graphics, pleasing to the eyes of the reader, and reducing the cognitive load of the reader.\n\nKey learning:\n\n-   control the placement of annotation on a graph by using functions provided in ggrepel package\n\n-   create professional publication quality figure by using functions provided in ggthemes and hrbrthemes packages\n\n-   plot composite figure by combining ggplot2 graphs by using patchwork package.\n\n## 2 Getting started\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Installing and loading the required libraries\nIn this exercise, beside tidyverse, four R packages will be used. They are:\n\nggrepel: an R package provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels.\nggthemes: an R package provides some extra themes, geoms, and scales for ‘ggplot2’.\nhrbrthemes: an R package provides typography-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2.\npatchwork: an R package for preparing composite figure created using ggplot2.\nCode chunk below will be used to check if these packages have been installed and also will load them onto your working R environment.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(ggrepel,patchwork,\n               ggthemes,hrbrthemes,\n               tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Importing data\nFor the purpose of this exercise, a data file called Exam_data will be used. It consists of year end examination grades of a cohort of primary 3 students from a local school. It is in csv file format.\n\nThe code chunk below imports exam_data.csv into R environment by using read_csv() function of readr package. readr is one of the tidyverse package.\n::: {style=\"font-size: 1.4em\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  geom_label(aes(label = ID), \n             hjust = .5, \n             vjust = -.5) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n:::\n",
