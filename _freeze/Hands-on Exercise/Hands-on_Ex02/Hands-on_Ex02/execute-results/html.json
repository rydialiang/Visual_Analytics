Key idea is to create more elegant and effective statistical graphics, pleasing to the eyes of the reader, and reducing the cognitive load of the reader.\n\nKey learning:\n\n-   control the placement of annotation on a graph by using functions provided in ggrepel package\n\n-   create professional publication quality figure by using functions provided in ggthemes and hrbrthemes packages\n\n-   plot composite figure by combining ggplot2 graphs by using patchwork package.\n\n## 2 Getting started\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Installing and loading the required libraries\n\nIn this exercise, beside tidyverse, four R packages will be used. They are:\n\nggrepel: an R package provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels. ggthemes: an R package provides some extra themes, geoms, and scales for ‘ggplot2’. hrbrthemes: an R package provides typography-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2. patchwork: an R package for preparing composite figure created using ggplot2. Code chunk below will be used to check if these packages have been installed and also will load them onto your working R environment.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(ggrepel,patchwork,\n               ggthemes,hrbrthemes,\n               tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Importing data\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, a data file called Exam_data will be used. It consists of year end examination grades of a cohort of primary 3 students from a local school. It is in csv file format.\n\nThe code chunk below imports exam_data.csv into R environment by using [read_csv()](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) function of [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package. **readr** is one of the tidyverse package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexam_data <- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThere are a total of seven attributes in the exam_data tibble data frame. Four of them are categorical data type and the other three are in continuous data type.\n\n-   The categorical attributes are: ID, CLASS, GENDER and RACE.\n\n-   The continuous attributes are: MATHS, ENGLISH and SCIENCE.\n:::\n",
