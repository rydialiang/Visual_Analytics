If not, you can proceed to enjoy reading the step by step thought process for this visualisation.\n\n## 1.0 Overview\n\n### 1.1 Setting the scene\n\nThere are two major residential property market in Singapore, namely public and private housing. Public housing aims to meet the basic need of the general public with monthly \\$14,000 for families/couples buying a new HDB flat. Singapore is a city-state with limited land resource. Housing, on the other hand, is one of the basic need of people of this city-state. In order to ensure that all citizen in the country can access to affordable housing, the government have initiated massive public housing programme since independent.\n\n### 1.2 The Task\n\nAssuming the role of a graphical editor of a media company, you are requested to prepare minimum two and maximum three data visualisation to reveal the ***private residential market*** and ***sub-markets of Singapore*** for the 1st quarter of 2024.\n\n## 2.0 Set Up\n\n### 2.1 Loading the packages into R\n\nT he `pac::p_load()` function to load the required R packages in the working environment. The following packages are used in this set up:\n\n-   ggthemes: Extra themes, geoms, and scales for ggplot2.\n-   tidyverse: A collection of core packages designed for data science, used extensively for data preparation and wrangling.\n-   ggridges: a ggplot2 extension specially designed for plotting ridgeline plots\n-   colorspace:\n-   ggiraph: for making ‘ggplot’ graphics interactive.\n-   plotly: R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\n-   patchwork: specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\n-   lubridate: for easy and fast parsing of Date / Time\n-   ggrepel: an R package provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels.\n-   ggdist: a ggplot2 extension specially design for visualising distribution and uncertainty\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load tidyverse from pacman\npacman::p_load(tidyverse,dplyr,ggridges,ggthemes,colorspace,ggiraph,plotly,patchwork, lubridate, ggrepel,ggdist)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### 2.2 Importing the data sets\n\nFive sets of data are provided for this exercise:\n\n1.  2023 Quarter 1 Residential Transaction: ResidentialTransaction20240308160536.csv\n2.  2023 Quarter 2 Residential Transaction: ResidentialTransaction20240308160736.csv\n3.  2023 Quarter 3 Residential Transaction: ResidentialTransaction20240308161009.csv\n4.  2023 Quarter 4 Residential Transaction: ResidentialTransaction20240308161109.csv\n5.  2024 Quarter 1 Residential Transaction: ResidentialTransaction20240414220633.csv\n\nAll five sets of data consists of past transactions between Q1 of 2023 to Q1 of 2024, with 21 variables that will be explored in detail after the data sets are imported.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load transaction data using readr, part of tidyverse package\ndata.23Q1 <- read_csv(\"data/ResidentialTransaction20240308160536.csv\")\ndata.23Q2 <- read_csv(\"data/ResidentialTransaction20240308160736.csv\")\ndata.23Q3 <- read_csv(\"data/ResidentialTransaction20240308161009.csv\")\ndata.23Q4 <- read_csv(\"data/ResidentialTransaction20240308161109.csv\")\ndata.24Q1 <- read_csv(\"data/ResidentialTransaction20240414220633.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo add new column `Quarter` into each of the csv file.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata.23Q1$Quarter <- rep('23Q1',nrow(data.23Q1))\ndata.23Q2$Quarter <- rep('23Q2',nrow(data.23Q2))\ndata.23Q3$Quarter <- rep('23Q3',nrow(data.23Q3))\ndata.23Q4$Quarter <- rep('23Q4',nrow(data.23Q4))\ndata.24Q1$Quarter <- rep('24Q1',nrow(data.24Q1))\n```\n:::\n\n\nCombining all the data set into one\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf <- rbind(data.23Q1,data.23Q2,data.23Q3,data.23Q4,data.24Q1)\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo have a basic understanding of all 22 variables, `glimpse()` is used with 2024 Q1 data.

You can refer to the FAQ, Data Dictionary and Methodology in [URA website](https://www.ura.gov.sg/reis/dataDictionary).\n\n*Qualitative*\n\n1\\. Nominal: `Project Name`, `Address`, `Type of Sale`,\n\n2\\. Ordinal: `Type of Area`, `Property Type`, `Sales Date`, `Purchaser Address Indicator`, `Postal Code`, `Postal District`, `Postal Sector`, `Planning Region`, `Planning Area` and `Quarter`.\n\nSome of the variables I have classified under ordinal are contextual. For example, I can choose to fill in the order for `Purchaser Address Indicator` as `Private` category is higher order than `HDB` category. The context is purchaser that address is `Private` is likely to be a person with higher Social Economic Status (SES) compared to a purchaser with `HDB` as address. Same could be applied to `Postal Code`, `Postal District`, `Postal Sector`, `Planning Region` and `Planning Area`.\n\n*Quantitative*\n\n3\\. Discrete: `Number of Units` and `Tenure`. Note that `Tenure` is still a chr data type as of now. If we choose to use this column for analysis, we do need to do data preparation on this. `Tenure` could also be classified under continuous data for more granularity.\n\n4\\. Continuous: `Transacted Price ($)`,`Area (SQFT)`, `Unit Price ($ PSF)`, `Area (SQM)`, `Unit Price ($ PSM)`, and `Nett Price($)`. Note that `Nett Price($)` is still a chr data type as of now. If we choose to use this column for analysis, we do need to do data preparation on this.\n\nSpecial Case: `Completion Date` is classified as chr, but a quick look at the data `df`, we will realise that this variable is a mix of quantitative and qualitative data type of `Uncomplete` and actual date of completion, which could be converted and analyse as doubles.\n\nSome important observations: 1. `Transacted Price ($)` and `Nett Price($)` are similar. In this analysis, we will use `Transacted Price ($)` for simplicity, as `Nett Price($)` has fair amount of missing data, and it is prices after deducting the value of the indirect discounts or benefits, and not representive for all transactions. 1. `Area (SQFT)` and `Area (SQM)`, and `Unit Price ($ PSF)` and `Unit Price ($ PSM)` are similar measures in different unit. We will use `Area (SQFT)` and `Unit Price ($ PSF)`\n\nNext we look at the basic statistics of the current data using summary()\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### The Output\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n Project Name       Transacted Price ($)  Area (SQFT)       Unit Price ($ PSF)\n Length:26806       Min.   :   440000    Min.   :   322.9   Min.   : 138      \n Class :character   1st Qu.:  1280000    1st Qu.:   721.2   1st Qu.:1384      \n Mode  :character   Median :  1660000    Median :   990.3   Median :1762      \n                    Mean   :  2143286    Mean   :  1191.6   Mean   :1852      \n                    3rd Qu.:  2320000    3rd Qu.:  1302.4   3rd Qu.:2260      \n                    Max.   :392180000    Max.   :144883.4   Max.   :5756      \n                                                                              \n  Sale Date           Address          Type of Sale       Type of Area      \n Length:26806       Length:26806       Length:26806       Length:26806      \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n   Area (SQM)      Unit Price ($ PSM) Nett Price($)      Property Type     \n Min.   :   30.0   Min.   : 1484      Length:26806       Length:26806      \n 1st Qu.:   67.0   1st Qu.:14893      Class :character   Class :character  \n Median :   92.0   Median :18966      Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n Mean   :  110.5   Mean   :19930                                           \n 3rd Qu.:  121.0   3rd Qu.:24327                                           \n Max.   :13460.0   Max.   :61962                                           \n NA's   :6                                                                 \n Number of Units     Tenure          Completion Date   \n Min.   : 1.000   Length:26806       Length:26806      \n 1st Qu.: 1.000   Class :character   Class :character  \n Median : 1.000   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n Mean   : 1.005                                        \n 3rd Qu.: 1.000                                        \n Max.   :60.000                                        \n                                                       \n Purchaser Address Indicator Postal Code        Postal District   \n Length:26806                Length:26806       Length:26806      \n Class :character            Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character            Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                                                  \n                                                                  \n                                                                  \n                                                                  \n Postal Sector      Planning Region    Planning Area        Quarter         \n Length:26806       Length:26806       Length:26806       Length:26806      \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### The Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# data summary\nsummary(df)\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\nFrom the continuous data above, we can conclude that there is a possibility of extreme outliers.

Otherwise, those 7 cases of transactions with more than one unit sold should be included as are likely the cases of purchase of multiple units or the purchase of multiple adjacent plots of land.\n\nLet's take a quick look at distribution before any data wrangling:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = `Transacted Price ($)`,            \n           x = `Property Type`)) +\n  geom_boxplot()+\n  facet_grid(~Quarter) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(1,6)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  theme_wsj() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = df ,\n       aes(x = `Transacted Price ($)`,\n           y = Quarter,\n           fill = factor(stat(quantile))\n           )) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE,\n    quantiles = 4,\n    quantile_lines = TRUE) +\n  scale_fill_economist(name = \"Quartiles\") +\n  theme_ridges() +\n  facet_wrap(~`Property Type`,scales = \"free\") +\n  theme_economist() +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = NULL)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### 2.3.1 Identifying Sub-markets\n\n**Land vs. Strata**\n\nTo lend some background context, you can refer to this link: [Landed vs. Strata Landed](https://plbinsights.com/landed-vs-strata-landed-whats-the-difference-how-have-they-performed-in-recent-years/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20URA%20website,as%20a%20pure%20landed%20property.) Basically, `Strata` means you only owns the property build on this land, but do not own the land itself. `Land` means you own the land and have more freedom and responsibility in terms of the constructions etc. The application of this knowledge for analysis is that `Strata` and `Land` classification can be identify as the sub-markets as owning a piece of land is likely to be more expensive for the purchaser compared to `Strata` title.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf %>%\n  filter(`Type of Area` == 'Land') %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x= `Quarter`,\n           fill = `Purchaser Address Indicator`)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_grid(~`Property Type`) +\n  theme_economist() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Land: No. of Transactions by Property Type\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf %>%\n  filter(`Type of Area` == 'Strata') %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x= `Quarter`,\n           fill = `Purchaser Address Indicator`)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~`Property Type`) +\n  theme_economist() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Strata: No. of Transactions by 'Property Type'\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo understand which `Type of Area` has high market value by `Transacted Price ($)`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf %>%\n  select(`Transacted Price ($)`,`Type of Area`) %>%\n  group_by(`Type of Area`) %>%\n  summarise(`Total Transaction Price ($)` = sum(`Transacted Price ($)`), `Mean Transaction Price ($)` = mean(`Transacted Price ($)`), `Median Transaction Price ($)` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  `Type of Area` `Total Transaction Price ($)` `Mean Transaction Price ($)`\n  <chr>                                  <dbl>                        <dbl>\n1 Land                              9051931648                     5765562.\n2 Strata                           48400988508                     1917934.\n# ℹ 1 more variable: `Median Transaction Price ($)` <dbl>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDiving a bit deeper.We segregate them by `Property Type`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf %>%\n  select(`Transacted Price ($)`,`Type of Area`, `Property Type`) %>%\n  group_by(`Property Type`, `Type of Area`) %>%\n  summarise(`Median Transaction Price ($)` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 10 × 3\n# Groups:   Property Type [6]\n   `Property Type`       `Type of Area` `Median Transaction Price ($)`\n   <chr>                 <chr>                                   <dbl>\n 1 Apartment             Land                                  6670000\n 2 Apartment             Strata                                1699394\n 3 Condominium           Strata                                1650000\n 4 Detached House        Land                                 11050000\n 5 Detached House        Strata                                4800000\n 6 Executive Condominium Strata                                1400000\n 7 Semi-Detached House   Land                                  5700000\n 8 Semi-Detached House   Strata                                3735000\n 9 Terrace House         Land                                  3705000\n10 Terrace House         Strata                                3038000\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## The Plot\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n## The Code\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf %>%\n  select(`Transacted Price ($)`, `Type of Area`, `Property Type`) %>%\n  group_by(`Property Type`, `Type of Area`) %>%\n  summarise(`Median Transaction Price ($)` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, .groups = 'drop')) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = `Property Type`, \n             y = `Median Transaction Price ($)`, \n             color = `Type of Area`)) +  # Adding color aesthetic based on Type of Area\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_economist() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  labs(color = \"Type of Area\")\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\nSome learning points from these plots and tibbles:\n\n1.  Apartment, Condominium and Terrace House seems to be affected most by outliers. There are two extreme outliers for transactions in 23Q1 and they are the two en bloc sales with 60 and 47 units of condominium each. As mention, the 5 en bloc sales will be removed from the data set to enable meaningful analysis.\n\n2.  No. of transactions for Apartment classified under `Type of Area` as Land is low.There is no transaction of Condominium and Executive Condominium as these categories of Property Type are always strata for `Type of Sale`. The URA [Methodology](https://www.ura.gov.sg/reis/coverageandMethodology) Miscellaneous tab explains some of the terminologies.\n\n3.  No. of transactions for Detached House, Semi-Detached House and Terrace House are low compared to the rest of the three categories.\n\n4.  Sub markets to focus on based on the number of transactions could be the following lists.\n\n    -   For Land `Type of Sale`: Detached House, Semi-Detached House, and Terrace House.\n\n    -   For Strata `Type of Sale`: Apartment, Condominium, and Executive Condominium.\n\n5.  However, we should also note that we can prioritise the sub-market for analysis based on the total, mean and median `Transaction Price ($)` in each category (Land and Strata) instead of just looking at volume of transactions. In the `Type of Area` with Total of `Transacted Price ($)` tibbles above, we see that Land type transaction low in volume, the total transactions in the 5 quarters is about 1/5 the total transactions of Stata type sales. However, when we look at the mean and median `Transacted Price ($)`, we observe that mean and median `Transaction Price ($)` Land type is roughly 3 times of Strata type.\n\n    -   This mean that Land type has low volume for number of transactions but generally higher average `Transacted Price ($)`.\n\n    -   For Strata type, it has high volume but lower average `Transacted Price ($)`.\n\n6.  Lastly, the scatter plot of median `Transaction Price ($)` suggest that there is a difference in the median price for the same `Property Type` with different `Type of Area`. Hence, the should study each of this sub-markets individually.\n\n### 2.4 Data Wrangling\n\nIn this section, we aim to clean the data set to ensure the usefulness and accuracy of the visualisation.\n\nThis is achieved by:\n\n1.  Removing irrelevant data and outliers\n2.  Appropriate categorisation of variables\n3.  Additions of new variables to add new dimensions to analysis\n\n### 2.4.1 Removing the en bloc sales (irrelevant data)\n\nFor the follow code chunk, we aim to remove all the enbloc sales, including the 5 transactions that we have found in section 2.3. While we have no idea if there are more than 5 cases of en bloc sales, the follow code chunk will effectively remove all the rows with the string \"ENBLOC\" in `Address` column.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf.c <- df %>%\n  filter(!grepl('ENBLOC', df$Address))\ndf.c\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 26,801 × 22\n   `Project Name`      `Transacted Price ($)` `Area (SQFT)` `Unit Price ($ PSF)`\n   <chr>                                <dbl>         <dbl>                <dbl>\n 1 THE REEF AT KING'S…                2317000          883.                 2625\n 2 URBAN TREASURES                    1823500          883.                 2066\n 3 NORTH GAIA                         1421112         1076.                 1320\n 4 NORTH GAIA                         1258112         1033.                 1218\n 5 PARC BOTANNIA                      1280000          872.                 1468\n 6 NANYANG PARK                       5870000         3323.                 1767\n 7 PALMS @ SIXTH AVEN…                4950000         4521.                 1095\n 8 N.A.                               3260000         1555.                 2096\n 9 WHISTLER GRAND                      850000          441.                 1926\n10 NORTHOAKS                          1268000         1604.                  791\n# ℹ 26,791 more rows\n# ℹ 18 more variables: `Sale Date` <chr>, Address <chr>, `Type of Sale` <chr>,\n#   `Type of Area` <chr>, `Area (SQM)` <dbl>, `Unit Price ($ PSM)` <dbl>,\n#   `Nett Price($)` <chr>, `Property Type` <chr>, `Number of Units` <dbl>,\n#   Tenure <chr>, `Completion Date` <chr>, `Purchaser Address Indicator` <chr>,\n#   `Postal Code` <chr>, `Postal District` <chr>, `Postal Sector` <chr>,\n#   `Planning Region` <chr>, `Planning Area` <chr>, Quarter <chr>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the df.c tibble, it showed that 5 rows had been removed.
