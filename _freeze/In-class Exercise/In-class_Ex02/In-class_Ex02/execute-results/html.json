The learning outcome of this chapter is learning the following two distribution by using ggplot and its extension:\n\n1.  Ridgeline plot\n\n2.  Raincloud plot\n\n## 2.0 Getting Started\n\n### 2.1 Installing and loading the packages\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, the following R packages will be used, they are:\n\n-   ggridges: a ggplot2 extension specially designed for plotting ridgeline plots\n\n-   ggdist: a ggplot2 extension specially design for visualising distribution and uncertainty\n\n-   tidyverse: a family of R packages to meet the modern data science and visual communication needs\n\n-   ggthemes: a ggplot extension that provides the user additional themes, scales, and geoms for the ggplots package\n\n-   colorspace: an R package provides a broad toolbox for selecting individual colors or color palettes, manipulating these colors, and employing them in various kinds of visualisations.\n\nThe code chunk below will be used load these R packages into RStudio environment.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(tidyverse,ggdist,ggthemes,\n               colorspace,ggridges)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### 2.2 Data Import\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, Exam_data.csv will be used.\n\nIn the code chunk below, [read_csv()](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) of [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package is used to import Exam_data.csv into R and saved it into a tibble data.frame.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexam <- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 3.0 Visualising Distribution with Ridgeline Plot\n\n[Ridgeline plot](https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/ridgeline.html) (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\n\nFigure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English score by class.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](In-class_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Note** - Ridgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\n\n-   It works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n### 3.1 Plotting ridgeline graph: ggridges method\n\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, you will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\n\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\n\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## The Plot\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](In-class_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = MATHS,\n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 2,\n    fill = lighten(\"#CC99FF\", 0.5),\n    color = \"black\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"Maths grades\",\n    expand = c(0,0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(3,3))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n### 3.2 Varying fill colors along the x axis\n\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either `geom_ridgeline_gradient()` or `geom_density_ridges_gradient()`. Both geoms work just like `geom_ridgeline()` and `geom_density_ridges()`, except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill. For technical reasons, we can have changing fill colors or transparency but not both.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## The Plot\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](In-class_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = MATHS,\n           y = CLASS,\n           fill = stat(x))) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n  scale_fill_continuous(name = \"Scores\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"Maths grades\",\n    expand = c(0,0)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n### 3.3 Mapping the probabilities directly onto colour\n\nBeside providing additional geom objects to support the need to plot ridgeline plot, ggridges package also provides a stat function called `stat_density_ridges()` that replaces `stat_density()` of ggplot2.\n\nFigure below is plotted by mapping the probabilities calculated by using `stat(ecdf)` which represent the empirical cumulative density function for the distribution of English score.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## The Plot\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](In-class_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = MATHS, \n           y = CLASS, \n           fill = 0.5 - abs(0.5-stat(ecdf)))) +\n  stat_density_ridges(geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\", \n                      calc_ecdf = TRUE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Tail probability\",\n                       direction = -1) +\n  theme_ridges()\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n**Note** It is important include the argument calc_ecdf = TRUE in `stat_density_ridges()`.\n\n### 3.4 Ridgeline plots with quantile lines\n\nBy using `geom_density_ridges_gradient()`, we can colour the ridgeline plot by quantile, via the calculated `stat(quantile)` aesthetic as shown in the figure below.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](In-class_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = MATHS, \n           y = CLASS, \n           fill = factor(stat(quantile))\n           )) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE, \n    quantiles = 10,\n    quantile_lines = TRUE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = \"Quartiles\") +\n  theme_ridges()\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\nInstead of using number to define the quantiles, we can also specify quantiles by cut points such as 5% and 95% tails to colour the ridgeline plot as shown in the figure below.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## The Plot\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](In-class_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = MATHS, \n           y = CLASS, \n           fill = factor(stat(quantile))\n           )) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE, \n    quantiles = c(0.05, 0.95)\n    ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    name = \"Probability\",\n    values = c(\"#FF00FFA0\", \"#FFE4E1A0\", \"#0000ffA0\"),\n    labels = c(\"(0, 0.05]\", \"(0.05, 0.95]\", \"(0.95, 1]\")\n  ) +\n  theme_ridges()\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## 4.0 Visualising Distribution with Raincloud Plot\n\nRaincloud Plot is a data visualisation techniques that produces a half-density to a distribution plot. It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of Maths score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by `ggdist` and `ggplot2` packages.\n\n### 4.1 Plotting a Half Eye graph\n\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using [`stat_halfeye()`](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/reference/stat_halfeye.html) of ggdist package.\n\nThis produces a Half Eye visualisation, which is contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## The Plot\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](In-class_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = MATHS)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n### 4.2 Adding the boxplot with `geom_boxplot()`\n\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using `geom_boxplot()` of ggplot2. This produces a narrow boxplot. We reduce the width and adjust the opacity.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## The Plot\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](In-class_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = MATHS)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA)\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n### 4.3 Adding the Dot Plots with `stat_dots()`\n\nNext, we will add the third geometry layer using stat_dots() of ggdist package. This produces a half-dotplot, which is similar to a histogram that indicates the number of samples (number of dots) in each bin. We select side = “left” to indicate we want it on the left-hand side.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## The Plot\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](In-class_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = MATHS)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 2)\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n### 4.4 Finishing Touch\n\nLastly, `coord_flip()` of ggplot2 package will be used to flip the raincloud chart horizontally to give it the raincloud appearance. At the same time, `theme_wsj()` of ggthemes package is used to give the raincloud chart a professional publishing standard look.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## The Plot\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](In-class_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = MATHS)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 2) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_wsj()\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## 5.0 Archival of In-class Ex_02 done in class\n\n## Histogram\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## The Plot\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](In-class_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](In-class_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_density(\n    color = \"#1696d2\",\n    adjust = .65,\n    alpha = .6\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n## The alternative design\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmedian_eng <- median(exam$ENGLISH)\nmean_eng <- mean(exam$ENGLISH)\nstd_eng <- sd(exam$ENGLISH)\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x= ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_density(\n    color = \"#1696d2\",\n    adjust = .65,\n    alpha = .6) +\n  stat_function(\n    fun = dnorm,\n    args = list(mean = mean_eng,\n                sd = std_eng),\n    col = \"grey30\",\n    linewidth = .8) +\n  geom_vline(\n    aes(xintercept = mean_eng),\n    color = \"#4d5887\",\n    linewidth = .6,\n    linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  annotate(geom = \"text\",\n           x = mean_eng - 8,\n           y = 0.04,\n           label = paste0(\"Mean ENGLISH: \",\n                          round((mean_eng), 2)),\n           color = \"#4d5887\") +\n  geom_vline(\n    aes(xintercept = median_eng)\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](In-class_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n-   T.S Kam, R for Visual Analytics [Chapter 9](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap09#visualising-distribution-with-raincloud-plot)\n",
